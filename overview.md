## Purpose

### Problem

An Android home screen should help people reach the application or device information they need quickly and accurately. Many launchers add widgets, feeds, advertisements, recommendations, and extensive customization until the home screen itself becomes another attention-demanding destination.

Launcher4Max begins with the author's daily need for a quieter and more direct path to applications and essential device information. Broader user demand and market differentiation remain hypotheses to validate.

### Product goal

Provide a restrained Android home screen that helps users find and open what they currently need with minimal distraction and cognitive overhead.

## Intended users

- Primary user: the author, who will judge whether the product is suitable for everyday use.
- Potential future users: Android users who prefer a calm, efficient, bilingual launcher experience.
- Explicitly unsupported user groups: To be decided through product discovery rather than inferred from the current concept.

## Product principles

- **Calm and intentional:** Every default element and interaction must justify its contribution to finding what the user needs.
- **Personal-first:** The author's willingness to use the product every day is the first product filter, while broader applicability is evaluated separately.
- **Direct Home access:** Restraint limits distraction, cognitive overhead, and avoidable steps; it does not require Home to contain few applications. Favorites remain directly available in one ordered full-width main list of vertical modules and horizontal ribbons without paging, folders, or another reveal surface.
- **Privacy-conscious:** Do not collect data unrelated to core functionality. Any future data access must be necessary, disclosed, minimized, and reviewed before implementation.
- **User control:** Avoid dark patterns, forced engagement, misleading permission requests, and designs intended to maximize time spent in the launcher.
- **Incremental evolution:** Grow one coherent product over time instead of maintaining unrelated variants.

## Confirmed boundaries

- Product form: an Android launcher intended to act as the device's default home-screen application.
- User-facing names: “Launcher4Max” in both English and Simplified Chinese.
- Supported languages: English and Simplified Chinese.
- Distribution boundary: public distribution through the GitHub repository only. Application-store submission is out of scope, and creating a GitHub Release, tag, or APK upload remains a separately authorized action.
- Platform baseline: ordinary Android phones in portrait orientation, with Android 12 (API 31) as the minimum supported version and Android 16–17 (API 36–37) as the primary physical-validation range.
- Author-centered ergonomics: interaction and placement decisions primarily optimize for right-hand holding with right-thumb input and left-hand holding with right-hand tapping. Other postures remain usable where practical but are not equal product-optimization targets.
- License: Apache License 2.0.
- Advertising and recommendation feeds are out of scope.

## Version direction

The following capability layers are a non-binding directional outlook. They are not a committed product roadmap, release plan, delivery sequence, or guarantee that any later capability will be implemented:

- **V1 — Fixed presentation:** User-controlled, deterministic presentation of applications and selected device information; no behavior-based automatic rearrangement.
- **V2 — Basic adaptation:** Optional behavior-based presentation or ordering, subject to explicit privacy, user-control, and validation requirements.
- **V3 — AI assistance:** A possible future direction outside the current product scope.
- **V4 — Agent integration:** A possible future direction outside the current product scope.

These labels describe capability direction rather than semantic software versions. They do not authorize V2–V4 work.

### V1 locality and permission constraints

- V1 remains fully local: no capability that requires network access, external services, or online data sources enters V1 without an explicit author exception.
- V1 adds no new sensitive permissions — for example notification access — beyond the purpose-limited accessibility authorization already accepted for screen locking; any further permission likewise requires an explicit author exception.

### V1 to V2 transition

- The transition is not triggered by time or by change size. It is triggered by capability: the first accepted capability that presents or orders content based on observed behavior.
- Behavior-based means derived from observed usage such as usage history, launch frequency, or time-of-day patterns. Explicit user selections — manual ordering or manual pinning — are user control rather than behavior and remain inside V1.
- Before any V2 capability enters the current contract, the author must explicitly decide to adopt it, the behavior data and its processing location must be characterized, user control must include disabling and recovery, and a validation plan must exist. A V2 adoption amends the V1 principle clause and the current-scope statement.
- For a V2 capability whose behavior data is collected, stored, and processed entirely on the device, the privacy review and disclosure burden is proportionally lighter and requires no external-service review. A capability that sends behavior data off the device keeps the heavier review bar.

## Current product scope

The current product contract defines a local, offline-capable daily-use utility loop across Home, Drawer, application launching, and necessary Settings. It provides direct favorite management, platform-bounded application discovery, and an optional purpose-limited screen-locking capability without making that accessibility authorization a condition for independent Launcher paths. Widgets, folder-like grouping, themes, extensive customization, network-backed information, accounts, cloud synchronization, and server development remain outside the current product scope.

The [product foundation requirements](docs/requirements/product-foundation.md) own the detailed current scope, platform and delivery boundary, product-level acceptance intent, dependencies, and open product questions. Applicable interaction specifications own surface-specific behavior; in particular, the [Drawer contract](docs/product/surfaces/drawer.md) owns application visibility, profile, and Private Space behavior. This overview does not create a second current-scope checklist.

## Additive requirements

An additive requirement is a capability that may be delivered when useful without defining or blocking the transition between V1, V2, and later capability layers. Landscape support, foldable and tablet adaptation, themes and colors, weather information, and widgets are current examples. Additive status does not itself require a capability-layer transition: a network-dependent example such as weather information may still be evaluated inside V1, but only with the explicit author exception required by the V1 locality constraint. Folder-like grouping is not an additive candidate because it conflicts with the current flat, directly visible favorite-module organization and adds a secondary reveal hierarchy.

Additive requirements are not automatically part of the current scope. Each must still pass the Feature decision test, be explicitly added to the current product contract, and satisfy applicable privacy, security, validation, and maintenance constraints.

## Feature decision test

Before a feature enters the current scope, answer:

1. Does it make finding the needed application or information faster, more accurate, or easier?
2. Does the default experience remain calm and understandable?
3. Would the primary user use it regularly?
4. Can users understand, control, disable, or recover from it where appropriate?
5. Are its privacy, accessibility, security, platform, and maintenance implications acceptable?

Features that do not pass this test should be rejected, deferred, or redesigned.

## Engineering intent

Engineering should prefer mature, maintainable choices, minimal dependencies, clear boundaries, safe defaults, and evidence-based validation. These are constraints on future technical evaluation, not a selection of a specific architecture, framework, API, or abstraction.

AI is expected to perform a substantial share of project execution under human review. The project author remains accountable for product direction, technical decisions, quality, and release decisions.

## Governance and documentation

- Project ownership and decision authority: the project author
- Agent and Toolkit routing: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- Documentation map and governance: [docs/documentation.md](docs/documentation.md)
- License: [LICENSE](LICENSE)

The current development, validation, release, and product Privacy contracts are established through the [documentation map](docs/documentation.md). Specialist system-architecture, security, and privacy-assessment documents remain unestablished until their creation conditions have real inputs; a planned path is not completed evidence.
