# Changelog

User-visible changes to Launcher4Max, newest first. The [completed delivery records](docs/delivery/) remain authoritative for scope, evidence, and known limitations.

Launcher4Max was named Avenor Launcher before `1.7.0`. Versions `1.0.0` through `1.6.0` were developed as the author's daily-use baseline and were not published as release artifacts. Version numbers follow the project's own version model rather than the official Semantic Versioning specification.

## Unreleased

### 1.7.0

- Bind the two Home basic-information gestures, double tap and long press, to No action, Edit mode, or Screen lock on a new Quick action settings page. Both slots default to No action.
- Screen locking is triggered by the gesture you bind and now ships in every build type. The Quick action settings page carries the always-visible screen-lock service state row and the accessibility authorization flow.
- Home shows a dismissible prompt while Launcher4Max is not the default launcher.
- The application-size block gains two three-stop tapering sliders.
- Home modules and Drawer gain independent icon and text sizes and a Hidden application-name placement.
- The standalone Double-tap-to-lock Settings entry is removed.
- **Breaking:** the application identity changed from `com.avenor.launcher` to `com.maxarchm.launcher`. Android treats `1.7.0` as a different application from `1.0.0` through `1.6.0`, so it cannot update an earlier installation in place. Move your data with the Settings backup file.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-09-10

- Back up favorites and settings to one local JSON file, and restore from a backup after an explicit confirmation.
- Add a favorite by long-pressing and dragging an application from Drawer into Home edit mode.
- The Home edit dock sits at the top of safe content, and the style settings panel expands and collapses as an animated slot swap.
- The Drawer background becomes a continuous opacity percentage slider with a live percentage readout.
- Favorite multi-selection marks selected rows with overlaid order badges on scaled, outlined cells.
