# Product Design Foundations

> Public semantic source: English. Chinese counterpart: [design-foundations.zh-CN.md](design-foundations.zh-CN.md).

## Responsibility

This document defines shared theme, layout, typography, color, icon, interaction, accessibility, and resource principles, and owns the exact reusable tokens shared by multiple surfaces. Exact component-specific and surface-specific values belong to the applicable presentation specification:

- [Home presentation](presentation/home.md)
- [Drawer presentation](presentation/drawer.md)
- [Style settings panel presentation](presentation/style-settings-panel.md)
- [Application action sheet presentation](presentation/app-action-sheet.md)
- [Settings presentation](presentation/settings.md)

The applicable navigation, surface, or feature specification owns product state and action results. A presentation specification does not add a control or behavior that the behavior contract does not include.

## Current theme

- All Launcher4Max surfaces use the dark theme. Text, icons, controls, and semantic color roles use their dark-theme presentation.
- Home paints no visible application background, preserving the system wallpaper without a persistent backdrop gradient, fixed scrim, blur, glass effect, or other full-surface contrast-protection layer. Its presentation specification owns the permitted foreground contrast treatment.
- Drawer's application background follows the user-selected background opacity defined by the [Drawer behavior](surfaces/drawer.md#display-settings) and [Drawer presentation](presentation/drawer.md#background-opacity-and-contrast) specifications. This bounded surface choice does not change the shared dark-theme semantic roles.
- Home and Drawer request transparent system-bar regions and draw edge to edge so their applicable surface treatment remains visible beneath the system bars. A transient local interaction cue remains permitted where its component specification defines one.
- Settings uses the opaque Launcher4Max dark color scheme through Material 3 semantic roles. Components use the shared roles below instead of page-specific dark hex colors.
- Modal sheets use `darkSurfaceBaseColor` unless their component presentation defines another dark surface, and preserve light status-bar icons.
- Platform or device contrast enforcement remains at its default behavior. Launcher4Max does not enter immersive mode or hide system navigation.
- Theme customization is an additive future capability outside the current contract.

## Shared dark-theme colors

The following ARGB values define the current reusable Launcher4Max dark-theme colors. Material components consume them through the corresponding semantic roles; the token name defines product meaning rather than an Android resource or API name.

| Token | ARGB value | Current semantic use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `darkSurfaceBaseColor` | `#FF202124` | Opaque base for Settings, dialogs, sheets, and other dark surfaces unless a component specification defines another surface treatment |
| `primaryTextColor` | `#FFFFFFFF` | Primary text and light monochrome foreground content; maps to the current `onSurface` and `onBackground` roles |
| `secondaryTextColor` | `#FFCAC4D0` | Supporting or lower-emphasis text and icons on the dark base; maps to the current `onSurfaceVariant` role |

`primaryTextColor` and `secondaryTextColor` have approximate contrast ratios of `16.10:1` and `9.44:1`, respectively, against `darkSurfaceBaseColor`. These fixed-surface ratios do not establish contrast against arbitrary Home wallpaper or Transparent Drawer wallpaper; those surfaces retain their specified shadow calibration requirement. `darkSurfaceBaseColor` does not add a whole-surface background to Home or to Transparent Drawer; a bounded element on either surface may still use it where the applicable presentation specification defines that element.

## Shared layout and typography

- Spacing, typography, color, shape, and visible-size values are semantic design tokens rather than arbitrary per-screen literals.
- Shared text color and size are independent axes. A component combines the applicable color, size, line height, and component-owned weight rather than inheriting an inseparable all-in-one text style.

The current shared text-size tokens are:

| Token | Font size | Line height | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `primaryTextFontSize` | `16sp` | `24sp` | Standard titles, medium application names, and other ordinary high-readability text |
| `secondaryTextFontSize` | `14sp` | `20sp` | Supporting text, compact controls, small application names, and other secondary-scale text |
| `largeAppNameFontSize` | `18sp` | `28sp` | Large application names only |

- `primaryTextFontSize` aligns with Material 3 `titleMedium` or `bodyLarge` dimensions, depending on component weight. `secondaryTextFontSize` aligns with `titleSmall` or `bodyMedium`. `largeAppNameFontSize` is an Launcher4Max-specific intermediate size rather than a stock Material 3 type-scale role.
- Layout and reachability primarily optimize for right-hand holding with right-thumb input and left-hand holding with right-hand tapping. Other postures remain secondary considerations.
- Typography follows system font scaling. Application names remain static, single-line, and end-ellipsized rather than using marquee motion.
- Font scaling beyond the current personal-use layout is not separately optimized. Text remains clipped to its one-line component boundary if extreme scaling exceeds that boundary.

## Shared icons and application identity

- A standard functional icon is `24dp x 24dp`. This value describes visible artwork, not its complete interaction boundary.
- An independently interactive standard functional icon remains inside a focusable target of at least `48dp x 48dp`. When an icon and label form one action, the combined item is one interaction and accessibility target.
- A standalone non-interactive status icon or loading progress indicator is `48dp x 48dp`. It has no separate touch target or ripple.
- Functional and status icons use the applicable semantic content color and consistent optical weight. An icon-only control has a localized accessibility name; decorative or already-labelled icons do not expose duplicate descriptions.
- Defining a shared icon token does not add the corresponding control to a surface.
- Native adaptive application icons follow the current device mask. Legacy icons are normalized within that mask while preserving recognizable artwork. Platform clone or profile badges are applied after normalization and remain consistent across application surfaces.
- If application artwork cannot be loaded, use Android's platform-default generic application icon with the same normalization and badge rules. Do not substitute an unrelated Launcher4Max icon.
- Current target devices are expected to provide clone or profile badges. Launcher4Max does not add a fallback badge or secondary identity label when the platform provides none.
- Exact parity with proprietary OEM shadows, icon packs, theme services, or other Launcher-specific effects is not required.

## Shared top app bar divider

- The Settings and Drawer top app bars separate themselves from the content directly below with one full-width `1dp` divider using shared `secondaryTextColor`. The divider has no horizontal inset, renders identically in every top-app-bar state, and does not make the bar an opaque surface. Exact placement belongs to the applicable presentation specifications.

## Shared interaction and accessibility

- Important interactive elements belong in the middle or upper regions of a surface. Bottom placement is a cautious exception that requires an author-accepted reachability reason.
- A control that toggles a state keeps its position, size, and interaction target across that state change. Its content may change, but the user's tap point must not move, shrink, or disappear.
- Interactive controls should provide a focusable target of at least `48dp x 48dp`. A smaller component-specific target requires an author-accepted reason and focused device evidence; dense layouts should first separate visible size from hit geometry.
- Pressed, focused, selected, and disabled states must not rely on color alone.
- Shared disabled content uses `38%` opacity, retains an explicit disabled accessibility state, and suppresses actionable ripple or activation. A component-specific contract may define an additional non-color indicator but must not invent an independent opacity as a durable product value.
- Every enabled click or long-press target provides a bounded Material ripple from the initial press unless its component contract defines another visible press state. The indication is clipped to the actual target and cancelled when input becomes scrolling, dragging, a surface transition, cancellation, or another non-click interaction.
- The current dark-theme ripple derives from `primaryTextColor`. A future light theme would derive it from that theme's foreground role; this does not add light-theme support now.
- Ripple communicates a press, not successful completion. Disabled targets do not present an actionable ripple.
- Haptic feedback respects system availability and user settings. Exact platform constants require implementation validation.

## Resource-backed values

User-facing strings, colors, dimensions, and other reusable presentation values must be resource-backed and localizable or themeable as applicable. They must not be scattered as hard-coded literals in product UI code. Exact Android resource and Compose access structure remains an implementation concern.
