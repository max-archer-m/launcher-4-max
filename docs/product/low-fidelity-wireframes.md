# Launcher4Max Low-Fidelity Wireframes

> Public semantic source: English. Chinese counterpart: [low-fidelity-wireframes.zh-CN.md](low-fidelity-wireframes.zh-CN.md).

The language-neutral ASCII canvases under `docs/product/wireframes/` visualize spatial hierarchy, region relationships, and major content order. They do not independently define product behavior, user-visible copy, exact visual values, or implementation structure.

## Reading rules

- Canvas labels are structural annotations, not user-visible copy.
- Dotted fill means only that space is allocated; it does not prescribe texture, color, opacity, or another layer.
- Repeated labels such as `L1`, `L2`, or numbered application entries are illustrative. They do not establish fixed content, capacity, or identity.
- A canvas may show one representative content state without defining all valid sizes, arrangements, loading states, error states, or edit states.
- The canvas boundary communicates composition, not a device profile or pixel-to-character scale. Dimensions written in a wireframe description are ASCII canvas dimensions, not product UI values.
- Application names remain illustrative. Localization, truncation, typography, icon size, spacing, targets, and visual states belong to the applicable behavior or presentation contract.
- Unallocated Home space remains transparent background rather than an unnamed product module.

## Contract routing

Use the owning document for a product decision instead of interpreting the wireframe:

| Question | Behavior owner | Exact presentation owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home content, editing, drag results, and container lifecycle | [Home interaction](surfaces/home.md) | [Home presentation](presentation/home.md) |
| Drawer inventory, search, sorting, selection, index behavior, and settings actions | [Drawer interaction](surfaces/drawer.md) | [Drawer presentation](presentation/drawer.md) |
| Application action availability, order semantics, and results | [Application action sheet](surfaces/app-action-sheet.md) | [Application action sheet presentation](presentation/app-action-sheet.md) |
| Settings content, navigation, and results | [Settings interaction](surfaces/settings.md) | [Settings presentation](presentation/settings.md) |
| Icon-shape modes, proportion semantics, and preview behavior | [Icon shape](features/icon-shape.md) | [Settings presentation](presentation/settings.md) |
| Cross-surface transitions and system-return behavior | [Navigation](navigation.md) | Applicable surface presentation specification |

## Wireframe index

- [Home](wireframes/home.txt) — complete canvas showing fixed basic information, the dismissible default-Launcher prompt shown between that region and the list while Launcher4Max is not the default Launcher, the vertically scrolling heterogeneous favorite main list with representative peer modules, and the Home bottom app bar when that feature is on.
- [Home edit mode](wireframes/home-edit-mode.txt) — representative canvas showing the visible basic-information region, module headers, one module-local style panel with its selection outline, application editing on the other module, and the add-favorite entries.
- [Drawer](wireframes/drawer.txt) — representative Content-state canvas showing the fixed search region, ordinary, search, and multi-selection semantics, list anchors, Settings section, and alphabet index.
- [Application action sheet](wireframes/app-action-sheet.txt) — modal-state canvas showing the blocked background, scrim, and content order.
- [Settings](wireframes/settings.txt) — complete canvas showing navigation, Launcher status, and product-information regions.
- [Icon shape settings](wireframes/icon-shape-settings.txt) — page canvas showing the wallpaper-exposing live-preview window with its centered three-stop icon group and the panel-language settings block with the clip-mode selector and the corner-radius slider.

## Authority and update rules

A wireframe is a visual aid, not an independent product decision. When it differs from normative prose, the applicable behavior contract governs outcomes and the applicable presentation specification governs exact visual values.

Update a wireframe in the same documentation change when a confirmed spatial hierarchy, region relationship, or major content order changes. A behavior-only change or presentation-token-only change does not require editing a wireframe unless the canvas would otherwise become structurally misleading.
