# Development Guide

> Semantic source: English. Chinese counterpart: [development.zh-CN.md](development.zh-CN.md).

## Purpose

This document records the minimum current development baseline for Launcher4Max. It describes project configuration and available entry points; it does not claim that a command has run successfully unless corresponding validation evidence records that result.

## Current project configuration

- Repository root and Android project root: the repository root.
- Project structure: one Gradle application module, `:app`.
- Build scripts: Kotlin DSL.
- Gradle wrapper distribution: Gradle `9.4.1`, currently configured through the Aliyun distribution mirror.
- Android Gradle Plugin: `9.2.1`.
- Kotlin: `2.3.10`.
- Java language level: JDK 17.
- Android configuration: `minSdk 31`, `targetSdk 36`, and `compileSdk 37`.
- Application identity: `com.maxarchm.launcher`.
- Current configured version identity: `versionName 1.7.0`, configured `versionCode 8`; delivery and version closure are recorded in [1.7.0 delivery](delivery/1.7.0/delivery.md).
- Dependency repositories currently use Aliyun mirrors. `settings.gradle.kts` retains commented official-upstream alternatives for deliberate manual switching.

Treat these values as current repository configuration, not promises that every host already has the matching JDK, Android SDK, emulator, device connection, credentials, or cached dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- A JDK 17 installation.
- An Android SDK that supplies the platform and build tools required by the checked-in configuration.
- Network or local cache access sufficient to resolve the configured Gradle distribution, plugins, and dependencies.
- For installation or instrumented validation, an Android device or emulator visible to the Android tooling.

The exact Android SDK package list, supported IDE version, and host-specific environment-variable setup are not yet established as project-wide requirements. Record a verified requirement here when it becomes necessary; do not infer it from one machine.

## Development entry points

Run Gradle from the repository root with the checked-in wrapper:

- macOS, Linux, or another POSIX shell: `./gradlew <task>`
- Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell: `gradlew.bat <task>`

Common configured task intentions include assembling an installable build, running JVM tests, running lint, and running connected Android tests. The authoritative task names and execution rules are maintained in [validation.md](validation.md).

An agent does not run Gradle for routine authoring or review unless the project author explicitly requests it or an authorized formal-version or focused-validation task requires it. This execution rule does not prevent the author from running the same wrapper tasks directly.

## Configuration changes

- Keep the Android project at the repository root and preserve the current single-module structure unless an authorized technical change requires otherwise.
- Treat changes to SDK levels, application identity, version identity, signing, repositories, wrapper, build plugins, or dependency versions as explicit build-configuration changes.
- Update this guide and [validation.md](validation.md) when a configuration change alters prerequisites, commands, validation coverage, or observed limitations.
- Do not treat an available newer tool or dependency version as a required upgrade or a failed build.

## Troubleshooting boundary

When a build or run fails, record the exact command, host operating system and shell, relevant JDK and Android SDK identity, first actionable error, and whether dependency resolution used mirrors or official upstream repositories. Keep transient logs outside authoritative documentation. Add a durable troubleshooting rule here only after the cause and remedy have been confirmed and are likely to recur.
