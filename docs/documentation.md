# Project Documentation Map and Governance

> Semantic source for public use: English. Chinese counterpart: [documentation.zh-CN.md](documentation.zh-CN.md).

## Purpose

This document defines the single authoritative location, creation condition, and maintenance rules for each type of Launcher4Max project information. A planned path does not mean that its conclusions exist, and empty documents must not be created merely to complete the directory structure.

The project author is the first accountable person for all project matters. Security, privacy, legal, financial, or platform-policy conclusions must receive qualified specialist review when required.

## Document categories

Repository documentation uses four practical categories. The category explains a document's responsibility; it does not create an additional approval or lifecycle system.

| Category | Governing question | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project governance | How is project work routed, authorized, documented, and maintained? | `AGENTS.md`, this document, delivery formats |
| Current facts and rules | What product behavior, technical configuration, development, validation, and release rules apply now? | `overview.md`, `docs/product/`, `development.md`, `validation.md`, `release.md` |
| Decision rationale | Why does a consequential confirmed product or architecture direction exist? | Product decisions and ADRs |
| Delivery records | What does a named version or iteration deliver, and what actually happened? | Stable version delivery directories, version delivery records, and iteration contracts |

`LICENSE` remains the applicable legal instrument and does not need a documentation category. Temporary prompts, scratch notes, unchecked task lists, and conversation transcripts are working material, not authoritative project documentation.

## Single authoritative source

Each durable fact has one primary location. Other documents link to or briefly identify that source instead of reproducing its rules.

| Information | Primary source |
| --- | --- |
| Project routing and project-specific authorization boundaries | `AGENTS.md` |
| Documentation locations and maintenance rules | `docs/documentation.md` |
| Durable product purpose, principles, capability layers, and long-term boundaries | `overview.md` |
| Current product scope, cross-feature requirements, and product-level acceptance intent | The applicable requirements document, currently `docs/requirements/product-foundation.md` |
| Current surface, feature, and navigation behavior | The applicable interaction specification under `docs/product/` |
| Shared and component presentation values | `docs/product/design-foundations.md` or the applicable component presentation specification |
| Spatial visualization and structural examples | `docs/product/low-fidelity-wireframes.md` and `docs/product/wireframes/`, as non-normative views of the linked contract |
| Development environment and build entry points | `docs/development.md` |
| Validation methods, evidence states, and execution authority | `docs/validation.md` |
| Delivery levels, artifacts, signing, and release operations | `docs/release.md` |
| Version scope, selected level, gates, iteration status, evidence and results, and version result | The version's `delivery.md` |
| Iteration objective, scope, constraints, acceptance conditions, and validation requirements | The applicable iteration contract |
| Consequential technical rationale | The applicable active or superseded ADR |
| Role authority | The Toolkit role definitions and authorization matrix |

When two authoritative documents state the same rule, select one owner and replace the duplicate with a link. A delivery record may summarize the scope it selects, but it must not become a second product specification, presentation specification, validation guide, architecture document, or release policy.

Classify a value by what it controls rather than by whether it is numeric. A gesture threshold that changes an action result belongs to the applicable interaction specification. A capacity limit belongs to the applicable product requirement or behavior specification. Font size, weight, line height, spacing, padding, margin, radius, opacity, visible icon size, and other reusable visual geometry belong to the applicable presentation specification. A minimum interaction target or another accessibility boundary belongs to the shared design or component contract that owns that requirement.

## Current product contract and delivery history

Current product documents describe the continuously maintained product contract and the intended product behavior. They are not claims that every historical or planned version already implements the complete contract.

Version delivery records describe selected scope and actual delivery history; iteration contracts describe the authorized boundary and acceptance conditions for each iteration. A completed result is evaluated from the version delivery record against the applicable iteration contract, selected version scope, delivery level, and recorded evidence. Later changes to the current product contract do not retroactively change that historical result.

When a delivery record needs to explain a boundary, it should prefer positive selected scope and observable acceptance criteria. Record an exclusion only when it prevents a likely scope misunderstanding. Use `deferred` only when a later destination or future commitment has actually been confirmed; an unselected capability is not automatically deferred.

## Planned authoritative locations

Create the following documents only when real inputs exist:

| Path | Single responsibility | Creation condition | Language strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System boundaries, components, dependencies, data flows, and technical direction | The selected stack or current product definition requires architectural conclusions | English by default; add Chinese when a sustained cross-language need exists |
| `docs/security.md` | Security model, threats, controls, and response process | Architecture, permissions, data flows, or distribution provide enough input for security analysis | English by default; specialist conclusions require review; translate when needed |
| `docs/privacy.md` | Specialist privacy assessment of data inventory, processing purposes, retention, and user rights; distinct from the current product Privacy contract | Confirmed data, permissions, regions, distribution, or third-party processing require analysis beyond [`docs/product/features/privacy.md`](product/features/privacy.md) | English by default; specialist conclusions require review; translate user-facing material as distribution requires |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Concise chronological user-visible changes for an external repository or release audience | A public or repository-facing release needs a summary separate from protected delivery records | English public semantic source; add Chinese according to the actual audience |

## Product-document responsibilities

Maintain product information in three distinct responsibilities:

1. **Product direction:** `overview.md` records durable purpose, principles, capability layers, and long-term boundaries. A future `docs/roadmap.md` may record capability-layer movement from V1 to V2 to V3 to V4 and major project outcomes between those layers. It must remain more macroscopic than version or iteration planning.
2. **Current product definition:** Requirements Briefs and interaction specifications record current user behavior, state, constraints, and acceptance intent. They describe the current product rather than preserving version-by-version narrative history.
3. **Change rationale and delivery history:** Product decision records explain consequential scope choices. Iteration and version records describe project progress and implementation evolution without becoming a second copy of the current product definition.

### Behavior, presentation, and visualization

Maintain interface information through three separate responsibilities:

1. **Behavior specifications:** Requirements and the applicable navigation, surface, or feature specification define product logic, state, available actions, click and gesture results, transitions, failure and recovery behavior, persistence effects, capacity rules, and observable acceptance intent. They may name a semantic presentation choice, such as large, medium, or small, when that choice affects product behavior. They do not repeat exact reusable visual values owned by a presentation specification.
2. **Presentation specifications:** [`docs/product/design-foundations.md`](product/design-foundations.md) owns shared design principles and reusable values. When a component or surface accumulates enough independent presentation detail to require its own maintained source, create `docs/product/presentation/<scope>.md` with real confirmed content and add it to this map. Presentation specifications own exact font sizes, weights, line heights, spacing, padding, margins, visible sizes, radii, borders, opacity, and comparable visual geometry. They do not redefine product state or action results.
3. **Low-fidelity visualization:** [`docs/product/low-fidelity-wireframes.md`](product/low-fidelity-wireframes.md) owns notation and reading guidance; the files under `docs/product/wireframes/` visualize hierarchy, relationships, and representative composition. They link to behavior and presentation sources instead of copying their rules or exact values. A wireframe is not an independent product or presentation decision.

When one change affects more than one responsibility, update the owner of each changed fact and update another document only when its own representation actually changes. A behavior-only change does not require presentation or wireframe edits. A token-only change does not require behavior prose edits. A confirmed spatial change updates its presentation source and the affected wireframe, while the behavior specification changes only if product behavior also changes.

Completed delivery history may retain values that were part of its historical boundary and must not be rewritten merely to match the current contract. Active current-state documents do not receive that exception: move a duplicated fact to its designated owner and replace the other current-state copies with links or concise non-normative context.

### Interaction specifications

Create interaction specifications only when the applicable behavior is ready to be defined. Place page, dialog, panel, and other independently identifiable interface-surface contracts under `docs/product/surfaces/`. Place relatively independent features with their own activation, authorization, state, failure, privacy, or acceptance boundaries under `docs/product/features/`. Keep cross-surface foundations and shared product rules directly under `docs/product/`, for example:

- `docs/product/surfaces/home.md`
- `docs/product/surfaces/drawer.md`
- `docs/product/surfaces/settings.md`
- `docs/product/features/<feature>.md`
- `docs/product/shared-components.md` when multiple specifications need a genuinely shared interaction contract

Each specification is the authoritative current definition for its own responsibility. Classify it by its primary product responsibility rather than its implementation location: a feature may be triggered from one surface and still belong under `features/` when its independent boundary is the reason for the document. It may link to surface, feature, or shared component rules instead of duplicating them. It must not preserve a chronological history of every version or iteration; use product decisions, delivery records, and Git history for that purpose.

When an iteration changes current behavior, record the before-and-after delivery scope in the iteration contract, follow `docs/product-decisions.md` when the author has enabled decision records, and update the affected current product specification in the same change or before integrating the implementation.

## Roadmap, versions, iterations, milestones, and completed records

These records answer different questions and must not replace one another or the current product definition.

### Roadmap

A future `docs/roadmap.md` records long-term capability-layer direction and major project outcomes. It may describe movement between V1, V2, V3, and V4, but it does not authorize later capability layers, prescribe detailed page behavior, or track ordinary implementation tasks.

### Version-delivery records

Use one stable `docs/delivery/<version>/` directory for each version from initial planning through completion, where `<version>` is the exact `versionName` without a `v` prefix. Keep the version summary and its iterations together:

```text
docs/delivery/<version>/
- delivery.md
- delivery.zh-CN.md
- iteration-<number>-<title>.md
- iteration-<number>-<title>.zh-CN.md
```

Follow [`docs/versions/version-delivery-format.md`](versions/version-delivery-format.md). `delivery.md` contains the selected product scope, necessary technical conclusions, included iterations, iteration status and delivery history, validation, limitations, completion criteria, and result. Create a separate technical assessment only when an independent review is genuinely needed; after resolution, place durable conclusions in their single authoritative current or delivery source instead of maintaining a permanent duplicate.

The directory name and path do not encode lifecycle state. `delivery.md` records whether the version is incomplete or completed and the evidence supporting that result.

### Milestones

For this project, a milestone is an exceptional baseline explicitly declared by the project author and represented by an approved Git tag. A GitHub Release is optional and exists only when the author also chooses an outward-facing publication. A formal version, iteration, unapproved tag, or approved tag not declared as a milestone does not become a milestone automatically. Milestones do not organize ordinary version delivery, and no `docs/milestones/` directory is used.

### Iteration contracts

Create one separate iteration contract beside `delivery.md` under `docs/delivery/<version>/` when implementation planning begins and an actual delivery iteration exists. Follow [`docs/iterations/iteration-record-format.md`](iterations/iteration-record-format.md). Do not replace the contract with an embedded section in `delivery.md`.

- Iteration identifiers use one project-wide, monotonically increasing positive-integer sequence starting with `1`, without leading zeroes.
- Never renumber, reuse, or restart the sequence after a version completes.
- An iteration is a reviewable delivery unit. Its boundary is decided from implementation difficulty, expected time, change breadth, dependencies, technical risk, and validation cost together, not solely from the product hierarchy or a fixed number of features.
- An iteration may implement all or part of the current product definition, or combine tightly coupled work required to produce one verifiable result. It must not silently introduce scope absent from current product documents.
- Each contract should state the objective, product-document references, before-and-after behavior where applicable, in-scope work, exclusions, dependencies, risks, affected code areas at a durable level, acceptance conditions, validation requirements, and related durable decisions or assessments.
- Each new contract must identify the full Git commit of its accepted product-contract baseline and link the applicable product sources at that revision. It selects a bounded delivery subset from those sources instead of copying their behavior or presentation rules.
- The contract identifies intended technical change areas and delivery consequences at a durable level. The version `delivery.md` records actual implementation evolution and evidence; Git commits and diffs remain authoritative for line-by-line source history.

Iteration contracts define a stable product-delivery boundary. They do not own `Planned`, `In Progress`, `Completed`, or `Cancelled` state, transition dates or bases, actual evidence, commits, tags, final results, or remaining delivery issues. The sibling version `delivery.md` is the single authoritative source for those project-delivery facts. A state transition normally changes only `delivery.md` and its maintained language counterpart; do not modify the iteration contract merely to mirror state.

An authorized amendment may update an incomplete iteration contract when its scope or acceptance boundary changes. After `delivery.md` marks the iteration `Completed` or `Cancelled`, preserve the contract's historical meaning and limit later edits to identified factual, link, or translation corrections. Existing historical iteration records are not rewritten only to adopt this separation.

### Completed version records

When a version completes, retain its stable `docs/delivery/<version>/` path and update `delivery.md` as the factual completion summary and entry point. Completion changes the record's historical protection, not its location.

- The folder name remains the exact declared software version without a `v` prefix and follows [`docs/release.md`](release.md). Do not add lifecycle suffixes such as `-archived`. Tag presence is optional and does not determine whether a version is complete.
- Do not create a second authoritative copy under an archive, completed, or status-specific directory.
- The summary lists each included iteration as `<iteration identifier> - <title>`, links to the original iteration contract in the same stable version directory, and records its authoritative status, latest transition date, and basis.
- The summary records the version outcome, included iteration range or explicit set, important product changes, implementation evolution, decisions, migrations, validation evidence, known limitations, related tag or release when one exists, and the reason the version boundary was declared.
- Completion does not reset the project-wide iteration sequence. If one completed version contains iterations `iteration-7-...` through `iteration-10-...`, the next active iteration is `iteration-11-...`.
- Do not rewrite completed iteration contracts or historical records to make later history appear cleaner. Correct factual errors explicitly and preserve their original delivery meaning.
- Every formal version contains one or more completed iterations.

Do not create roadmap, version, or iteration files before their real planning or implementation inputs exist. Format documents may exist before individual delivery records because they govern how later records are created.

## Language and translation

- Temporary working notes and checklists do not require English versions and must not become dependencies of committed authoritative documents.
- README, the product overview, and agent instructions currently have English and Chinese versions.
- Translate other documents only when cross-language reading or the external audience creates a real need; do not create counterparts for structural symmetry.
- When authoring begins in Chinese, provide the public English version before treating the document pair as complete. The published English document is the external semantic source.
- Bilingual documents must preserve the same scope, constraints, and normative meaning. Correct material differences in the same change; when synchronization cannot be completed, explicitly record the discrepancy and follow-up.
- Use English for commit messages, pull requests, issues, release notes, and other public repository output.

## Updates and review

- Update affected authoritative documents immediately when product scope, architecture, data processing, platform, distribution channel, validation process, or another documented boundary changes.
- At the end of each formal version and milestone, review documentation entry points, links, status, and cross-document consistency.
- Review security, privacy, license, and release documentation again before the applicable release gate.
- Do not present plans, assumptions, or unresolved items as completed facts.
- For documentation-only changes, at minimum validate local Markdown links and inspect the Git diff and bilingual semantic alignment.

## Versioning and historical protection

- Update ordinary guides and current-state documents in the same change as the affected boundary; do not retain obsolete content as narrative history.
- Use append-only, zero-padded ADR names in the form `0001-<decision>.md`. Never renumber, reuse identifiers, or rewrite historical decisions. Apply the Toolkit ADR rule.
- Keep Requirements Brief boundaries and acceptance criteria traceable. Record material scope changes explicitly rather than silently overwriting the current product definition.
- Keep current product specifications current; preserve consequential rationale in product decisions, iteration boundaries in iteration contracts, and delivery history in version delivery records.
- Product scope changes require an explicit decision from the project author and, when applicable, a technical impact assessment. A request becomes current product scope only when it is written into the applicable authoritative document.
- Security, privacy, and release records must preserve their applicable scope, version or date, and required specialist-review evidence.
- Move an obsolete document into historical storage only when it retains decision, audit, or migration value; otherwise delete it. Historical material must identify its replacement and must not be loaded as current guidance.

## Current-state document rule

- Repository-visible authoritative documents describe the current project or product state. They do not carry lifecycle status fields.
- Content that is not ready to become current project state remains in the conversation or an external continuation workspace such as `max-dev-context`; it does not enter this product repository as an operative document.
- Updating an authoritative current-state document changes the applicable current rule or definition. Preserve prior states through Git history, decisions, and completed delivery records rather than status labels inside the current document.
- When code exists, compare documentation, implementation, tests, and validation evidence before integrating a change. Resolve a material mismatch explicitly; neither side silently replaces the other.
- A completed `docs/delivery/<version>/` directory remains authoritative for the delivery history it describes but does not define current product or project rules. Its stable path does not make it active work.

## Git and task workflow

- The project may use multiple short-lived, scope-based branches and isolated worktrees under the authoritative coordination rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). Branches are execution isolation, not durable project status or an alternative authority to `main`.
- Treat each independently reviewable operation as one task. Complete it, report the result and evidence, and wait for author confirmation before beginning the next task.
- Modifying files does not authorize committing them; committing does not authorize pushing them. An Agent may perform modify, commit, and push in one uninterrupted sequence only when the project author explicitly authorizes that serial continuation.
- A broad objective does not by itself authorize every later mutation in its delivery chain. Read-only inspection and validation needed to report the current task remain part of that task.
