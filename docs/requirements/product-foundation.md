# Requirements Brief: Product Foundation and Current Scope

> Public semantic source: English. Chinese authoring counterpart: [product-foundation.zh-CN.md](product-foundation.zh-CN.md). Keep both versions materially aligned.

## Responsibility

This document defines the product problem, evidence boundary, target user, current capability scope, cross-feature requirements, data boundary, and product-level acceptance guardrails. It does not repeat page interaction flows or exact presentation values. Those facts belong to the linked product contracts under [Contract routing](#contract-routing).

## Problem

The author uses an Android phone as their primary device and commonly uses Samsung and Google phones. The Launcher is used whenever the author enters the home screen or needs to find an application. There is no reliable usage-duration or frequency measurement yet.

Existing products do not jointly satisfy the author's preference for a Home-and-Drawer structure, deliberate layout constraints, low visual noise, and personally useful customization. The author therefore wants an Android Launcher that first serves their own long-term daily use.

## Evidence boundary

### Known facts and author experience

- The author has long-term Android experience and has used stock and third-party Launchers.
- Current problem evidence consists of the author's sustained experience and understanding of their own needs.
- No usage counts, task-duration data, interviews, external-user feedback, or market research are available.

### Hypotheses to validate

- Limited and intentional layout rules may make an attractive, comfortable, and minimal daily Home easier to sustain than unrestricted customization.
- Whether other Android users share the same need is unverified.
- Whether the product should later be published through GitHub or application stores is unverified.

## Project motivation

- Product motivation: create a personally owned home-screen tool suitable for the author's long-term daily use.
- Learning motivation: use a real project to learn agent systems and build agent-engineering experience.

Learning goals may shape process and retrospectives, but they do not replace user value, product acceptance, or quality standards.

## Target user and scenarios

The primary user is the author. Product trade-offs are evaluated first against reliable daily use by that person. Ergonomic decisions primarily optimize for right-hand holding with right-thumb input and left-hand holding with right-hand tapping; other postures are secondary.

There are no identified secondary users. Possible future publication does not demonstrate broader demand or expand the current audience.

Primary scenarios are:

- Enter the Android default Home.
- Move from Home to Drawer, find an application, and launch it.
- Open Settings and configure capabilities needed for basic Launcher utility.
- Complete these core tasks without a network connection.

## Product goal

Provide the author with an Android Launcher suitable for long-term daily use that is fully local and follows least-privilege principles, using Home, Drawer, and Settings to complete the basic home-screen utility loop.

The current scope covers utility, not mass-market suitability, extensive customization, or network information. The author's desire for capabilities unavailable or paid elsewhere is an expectation, not market evidence or a current acceptance criterion.

## Platform and delivery boundary

- Minimum supported version: Android 12 (API 31).
- Current physical validation devices: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra on Android 16 and Google Pixel 8 on Android 17.
- Minimum-version validation environment: an Android 12/API 31 emulator unless a representative physical device becomes available.
- Device scope: ordinary Android phones in portrait orientation only. Launcher4Max presents in portrait orientation only; rotation requests do not produce a landscape layout, and no surface defines landscape geometry.
- Device exclusions: landscape, foldable, tablet, desktop-mode, and external-display adaptation. Landscape presentation remains excluded until explicitly adapted.
- Distribution boundary: public distribution through the GitHub repository only. No application-store submission, website APK, or other distribution channel. Creating a GitHub Release, tag, or APK upload remains a separately authorized action.
- Store target-API, review, and data-disclosure requirements are not current delivery gates, because no store distribution is in scope.

The product compatibility boundary requires `minSdk` 31. Current configured `compileSdk`, `targetSdk`, and version values are maintained in the [development guide](../development.md); public-distribution target-API gates are maintained in [release governance](../release.md). This current product requirement does not preserve a historical version's SDK-selection instructions. Reviewed: 2026-08-28.

## Current product scope

### In scope

- Home: one non-pageable, non-collapsible default Home with fixed time and date above one vertically scrolling, full-width favorite main list and the Drawer gesture entry, plus a dismissible default-Launcher prompt between the fixed information region and that list while Launcher4Max is not the device's default Launcher.
- Favorites: one ordered heterogeneous sequence of full-width vertical modules and single-row horizontal ribbons, without an artificial module-count limit. A launchable identity appears in only one module. Vertical modules persist module-level icon size, name (text) size, name placement, and items-per-row values; ribbons use one fixed style.
- Favorite editing: explicit add, remove, move, reorder, resize, confirmation, cancellation, latest-removal Undo, and Drawer drag-to-favorite behavior defined by the Home and Drawer contracts.
- Screen locking: an optional, purpose-limited accessibility-service capability for eligible blank Home space, triggered by the quick-action slot the user binds to it. It does not gate independent Launcher paths.
- Quick actions: two user-configurable Home basic-information blank-space slots, each bound to `No action`, `Edit mode`, or `Screen lock`, defaulting to `No action`.
- Drawer: every launchable entry successfully read from Android-exposed sources, including cloned and work-profile entries when available, with ordinary-mode local application-name search and a user-selected background opacity from `0` (clear wallpaper) through `100` (solid surface color). A fresh configuration defaults to `50`. An isolated non-current-profile read failure does not block usable entries from other profiles.
- Application actions: application information and platform shortcuts on Home or Drawer; Home additionally provides remove-favorite, edit, and uninstall when the platform can safely address the selected identity, and Drawer provides uninstall under the same platform constraints.
- Settings: default-Launcher state and system destination, quick-action settings including the screen-lock authorization entry and its disclosure, Privacy, licenses, repository link, and version information as applicable; plus local manual backup and restore of favorites, quick-action bindings, and Drawer display settings through the system document picker.
- English and Simplified Chinese resources selected from system locale, with English fallback.
- Offline availability for core tasks, local core-data storage, and only permissions traceable to necessary core capabilities.

### Out of scope

- Visual polish whose primary purpose is aesthetic refinement.
- Widgets, folder-like grouping, Home paging, themes, and unrestricted layout or visual customization.
- One-action clearing or cloud deletion of all local configuration.
- Network-backed information such as weather.
- Accounts, cloud synchronization, a self-hosted server, or cross-device backup.
- Behavioral analytics, automatic ordering, recommendations, AI assistance, or agent integration.
- Android Private Space access, presentation, management, favorites, or restoration, including declaration of `ACCESS_HIDDEN_PROFILES`.
- Business-model validation, formal store release, or mass-market adaptation.

Out-of-scope capabilities are excluded from the current contract, not permanently rejected. Advertising, recommendation feeds, and engagement-maximizing design remain constrained by the project overview.

## Additive requirements

Landscape support, foldable and tablet adaptation, themes, weather information, and widgets may be evaluated as future additive capabilities. Folder-like grouping conflicts with the current direct-access principle and is excluded.

An additive capability does not enter current scope merely because it can be built independently, and it does not bypass product, privacy, security, validation, or maintenance review.

## Functional requirements

- Launcher4Max can serve as the Android Home entry point and exposes the Home–Drawer–Settings utility loop.
- While Launcher4Max is not the device's default Launcher, Home presents one dismissible prompt whose selection opens the same system destination as the Settings default-home entry and which changes no Launcher4Max state.
- Home displays system time and date, locally saved favorites, and launches the selected identity.
- Favorite identities distinguish primary, cloned, and work-profile entries and are not deduplicated solely by package name.
- Favorite mutations are explicit, locally persisted, and preserve a valid destination and order without duplication or silent redirection.
- Drawer presents, locally searches, and launches the reliable inventory available within Launcher4Max's Android role and least-privilege boundary.
- Inventory refresh, partial-source failure, permanent disappearance, Loading, and Error behavior preserve usable paths and do not convert uncertain data into destructive conclusions.
- Application actions and Settings open only destinations valid for the selected identity and report defined local failures without corrupting favorite state.
- Launcher4Max can back up the complete favorite-module, Drawer display-setting, and quick-action-binding state to one user-chosen local file and restore it through a confirmed atomic replacement without network access or automatic backup.
- Screen locking requests the system lock action only after the user binds a quick-action slot to it, enables the applicable accessibility service, and performs the bound gesture in an eligible area.
- English and Simplified Chinese are complete supported resource sets; unsupported locales fall back to English without a manual in-app language selector.
- Core Home, Drawer, application launch, and Settings tasks remain usable offline.

Detailed interaction outcomes and exact presentation values are acceptance requirements through the authoritative contracts in the routing table; they are not duplicated here.

## Non-functional requirements

- Core paths must not crash, become unresponsive, or corrupt local configuration because of Launcher4Max.
- Least privilege is mandatory. Permission denial may degrade only the dependent capability.
- User-visible strings are localizable, and system font scaling remains applicable.
- Current data remains local; no account, analytics, server, or cloud synchronization is introduced.
- Validation claims must identify actual evidence and follow [the validation guide](../validation.md).

The performance expectation is that the author's primary physical device runs the accepted core journeys. No numeric performance, power, memory, or startup-response thresholds are pursued, and none is a product-level completion condition.

## Product-level acceptance criteria

- The author can complete the Home–Drawer–Settings loop on the supported device boundary without a network connection.
- The Home default-Launcher prompt appears only while Launcher4Max is not the default Launcher, is suppressed for the remainder of the local day by its dismiss control, never changes Launcher4Max configuration, and opens the same system destination as the Settings entry.
- Selecting a visible launchable identity launches the intended application.
- Drawer does not omit, duplicate, or misidentify entries returned by successfully read Android sources; isolated failed sources may be absent without blocking available Content.
- Ordinary Drawer search filters the reliable local application inventory by displayed application name without network access, changing the selected arrangement, or introducing a second application order.
- Private Space identities requiring hidden-profile access remain outside inventory and permission declarations.
- Favorite identity, module destination, application order, applicable vertical-module style, and module order survive applicable recreation without unexpected loss, duplication, or reassignment.
- Failed or uncertain reads remain distinguishable from valid empty data and do not overwrite the last reliable favorite state.
- Permission denial or revocation affects only the dependent capability and leaves independent Launcher paths available.
- Local backup and restore preserve and restore the complete favorite, display-setting, and quick-action-binding state without network access, automatic backup, or loss of unrelated configuration.
- English, Simplified Chinese, and English fallback resolve according to system locale.
- Applicable surface behavior and presentation contracts are satisfied for the delivery's explicitly selected scope and evidence baseline.
- Results intended as daily-use acceptance are observed on the author's applicable physical devices; implementation completion alone is insufficient.

## Success assessment and guardrails

Core success means that Home, Drawer, and Settings form a reliable minimum utility loop for the author's ongoing daily use. Success is judged by the author's observed experience; uncollected external-user opinions are not evidence. “Attractive, comfortable, and minimal” has not yet been converted into observable standards and is not a current acceptance target.

## User control

The product lets users maintain Home favorites and use individual Settings entries. It provides manual local backup and restore of favorites, quick-action bindings, and Drawer display settings through the system document picker; it does not provide one-action clearing, cloud deletion, automatic backup, or cloud restoration of all configuration. Users can clear application data through Android system settings. Favorite changes result from explicit user actions, and language follows system locale rather than observed behavior.

## Local data boundary

- Durable user-content data consists of ordered favorite modules, module type, stable favorite identity and position, and applicable vertical-module size, name placement, and items-per-row values. A stable identity has one module destination and cannot be duplicated across modules.
- Durable local configuration also includes the selected Drawer application icon size, application name size, name placement, items-per-row count, section-anchor presentation, background-opacity percentage, and the quick-action binding of each Home basic-information slot. Each valid change is saved as one complete configuration state.
- Primary, cloned, and work-profile identities must remain distinguishable and must not be stored or deduplicated solely by package name.
- The latest eligible application-removal snapshot is transient Undo state, not durable undo history.
- The local date on which the user last dismissed the Home default-Launcher prompt is durable presentation state. It is user-controlled, is not application-usage history, and is not part of the backup file.
- Time and date come from the device system and are not retained historically.
- Launcher4Max does not collect or store accessibility window content or events, notifications, contacts, location, clipboard content, files, photos, stable device identifiers, application-usage history, or analytics events.
- Launcher4Max has no account, cloud synchronization, server, cloud backup, or cross-device backup. Android cloud backup and device-to-device transfer backup remain disabled for Launcher4Max-owned favorite and display-setting data; only the user-initiated local backup described below is provided.
- A user-initiated local backup writes one schema-versioned JSON file containing the complete favorite-module, Drawer display-setting, and quick-action-binding state to a location the user chooses through the system document picker. The file is user-managed, stays outside Launcher4Max's app-private storage, and is never uploaded or written automatically.

## Dependencies and risks

- The Android Home role, application-enumeration approach, cloned-entry visibility, and related declarations or permissions require continuing technical and privacy review.
- Future Private Space support requires a separate author-approved capability and renewed interaction, permission, privacy, compatibility, and validation review.
- Current evidence represents only the author and cannot support a mass-market demand conclusion.
- Learning agent systems may encourage process or technical complexity beyond product needs; control this through explicit scope changes.
